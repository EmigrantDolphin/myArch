mkinitcpio -p linux


boot with flashdrive having arch install on it. Mount arch partition. arch-chroot to mounted partition and run this command to regenerate init ram disk.

if i understood correctly, before the system is booted and the main root file system used. 
In order to boot it and find all devices, load modules and do all the stuff for the main root file system to be mounted
